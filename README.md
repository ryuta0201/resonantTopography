# Resonant Topography

This project visualizes a personal exploration algorithm inspired by
Bayesian optimization, spiral search, and cenote-like convergence.

## Core Concepts
- Fog: diffuse sampling / uncertainty
- Net: structured relational stability
- Fluid (Cenote): dissolution and reorganization into flow

## Status
Prototype (p5.js)

## Next
- Phase-weight blending refinement
- Fluid profile randomization
- Documentation of conceptual model
